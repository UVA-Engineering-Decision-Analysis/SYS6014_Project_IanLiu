\subsection{Project Introduction \&
Description}\label{project-introduction-description}}

As the concept of sharing economy has been globally proved to be
efficient, a relatively new economic model has been invented and
introduced, which is to use time as a tradable currency, to allow one
participant with specific skills to trade hours of work with another
participant with different skills. During the entire transaction,
although physical money is replaced by working hours, both parties of
the transaction still has achieved their objection of exchanging
services or needs. This new type of economic model is call time-banking.

For example, Jack will be out of town over the weekend for a conference
and needs someone reliable and trustable to take care of his child.
Maria, Jack's neighbor, is a professional registered nurse at the local
children's hospital and has free time over the weekend. However, due to
the nature of work, Maria must be on night shifts 4 times a week, so she
hardly finds a proper time window to mow her lawn. In fact, Jack is
getting a 2-day break from work when he returns back from the
conference, and he can mow the lawn at Maria's property as a return, in
exchange of Maria's time for taking care of his child over the weekend.

There actually have been a few successful platforms developed that help
the participants of time banking to look for potential partners.
However, things just become more complicated as the number of
participants is getting larger, which means that each participant must
make a decision when multiple matches have become available for them to
confront. Let's get back to Jack and Maria's case. What if there are
multiple help requests that Maria could accept for the weekend? What if
there are multiple babysitters available in the neighbor that Jack gets
to choose? Here comes a decision-making problem.

\hypertarget{the-decision-problem}{%
\subsection{The Decision Problem}\label{the-decision-problem}}

In this project, the decision-maker is someone who has published a
request on a peer-to-peer time-banking platform and has received
multiple offers. As the time window is closing, this person confronts a
situation where they must make a final decision as soon as possible, and
they wish the platform system could help them to select the best match.

The set of options is hard to define due to the complexity and diversity
of each participant's profile. And the system would calculate a weighted
expectation value for each participant based on the available
information provided in their profile.

The stakes of the decision vary depending on the nature of each
decision. However, we wish to find the best match, or the final decision
with the highest expectation value, for participants to choose. Poorer
decisions will definitely cause issues such as inequality and
resentment. Since the physical money does not get involved in the
transaction, it's pretty hard for people to intuitively evaluate work
with working hours. However, it is definitely not going to work out if
Maria babysits Jack's child for the entire weekend, but Jack only mows
Maria's lawn for 5 minutes.

\subsection{The Predictive Tool}\label{the-predictive-tool}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  What information does your chosen predictive tool provide? \newline 
  The predictive tool chooses the best match for a user by letting them
  fill out a survey-like form that contains necessary
  information/questions to make a decision, then the algorithm locates
  the option with the highest weighted score, based on Bayesian decision
  theory. \newline 
\item
  How will the decision maker use the information generated by this tool
  to make better decisions? \newline  When a user is publishing a
  request on the platform, they must agree to exchange services with
  time hours, but not the traditional money in the future. Having said
  that, they would need to provide all the skill sets, requirements and
  demands when they set up their profiles. And the algorithm will match
  them based on the information that they've provided in their profiles.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In what units are payoffs measured? \newline Payoffs are measured by
  timing hours, details will be provided in the future write-ups.
  \newline 
\item
  Programming language? \newline In order to prevent reinventing the
  wheel, I'd choose to use Python or R to complete this project.
  \newline
\item
  The rest of the questions are going to be very helpful for me to
  complete this project However, unfortunately, I don't have answers for
  them yet. \newline What are the uncertain state variables that
  influence the value of payoffs? \newline What is the range of possible
  values of these variables? \newline     What analytic technique(s)
  will you use to estimate the values of these uncertain state
  variables? \newline What data will you use in this estimation? Are you
  sure you can gain access to these data?
